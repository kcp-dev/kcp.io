[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) is just a **few days away**! The major European cloud native conference is set to kick off on Tuesday, April 1 in London, England!

The kcp project has prepared a lot of exiciting content and activites for this year's KubeCon EU. Just like at KubeCon NA last year, you'll have a chance to meet our maintainers at the **Project Pavilion** on **Wednesday, April 2, from 15:30 to 19:45 BST at the Kiosk 5A**. Feel free to drop by and talk anything about kcp or just say hi. ðŸ‘‹

We're very excited to present our [first hands-on workshop](https://sched.co/1tx6b) where attendees will have a chance to get familiar with multi-tenant Kubernetes APIs and controllers with kcp, while being guided by our maintainers and contributors. Join Robert Vasek, Nabarun Pal, Varsha Narsing, Marko MudriniÄ‡, and Mangirdas Judeikis, on **Wednesday, April 2, at 11:15 BST** for tons of learning and fun!

But that's not all, we're having two more kcp talks at KubeCon:

- [Thrusday, April 3, 11:00 - 11:30 BST: Extending Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) Beyond Kubernetes Workloads](https://sched.co/1txAB) - Mangirdas Judeikis, Cast AI & Nabarun Pal, Independent
- [Thrusday, April 3, 15:00 - 15:30 BST: Dynamic Multi-Cluster Controllers With Controller-runtime](https://sched.co/1txFM) - Marvin Beckers, Kubermatic & Stefan Schimanski, NVIDIA

We hope that youâ€™re as thrilled for KubeCon as we are! See you there!
