[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) will kick off in Salt Lake City on November 12, in less than a month.

After a very successful KubeCon Europe in Paris, we're happy to share that kcp maintainers will also be around in Salt Lake City. This time, kcp will also be at the **[Project Pavilion](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/project-engagement/#project-pavilion)** and maintainers will be around at a project kiosk on **Wednesday, November 13 from 3:15pm to 8:00pm**. Feel free to drop by to chat about kcp, ask questions or just say hi!

We are also excited to share the following sessions involving kcp. This time, we are happy to see talks coming from the wider community and utilizing kcp for their use cases.

- **Nov 13, 3:25pm**: [Deep Dive Into Generic Control Planes and kcp](https://sched.co/1i7lu) at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon -- Stefan Schimanski (Upbound), Mangirdas Judeikis (Cast AI)
- **Nov 15, 4:55pm**: [Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Slurm with Kubernetes in a Kubernetes Native Way](https://sched.co/1i7s5) at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon -- Eduardo Arango Gutierrez (NVIDIA), Angel Beltre (Sandia National Laboratories)

A special shoutout goes to the talk [Kubernetes Workspaces: Enhancing Multi-Tenancy with Intelligent Apiserver Proxying](https://sched.co/1i7nS) by James Munnelly and Andrea Tosatto (both Apple), which is not presenting kcp but leverages some of the language and concepts that originated in the kcp project. We're excited to see what they've built!
