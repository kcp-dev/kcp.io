  - title: "A Framework for Platforms"
    text: "kcp allows building platforms and SaaS-like services with technology already known to platform engineers: Kubernetes and its API capabilities."
  - title: "Multi-Tenancy at Scale"
    text: "Workspaces allow teams to work without interference from others when consuming platform services. Meanwhile, services are implemented as global operators."
  - title: "Dedicated to Community"
    text: "kcp is a CNCF Sandbox project and is proud to be part of the community. We value respectful collaboration with contributors and upstream projects above all."

goals:
  - title: "Multi-Tenancy for Peace of Mind."
    text: |-
      kcp implements fully-isolated workspaces, each acting as its own Kubernetes-like cluster, with its own URL endpoint, its own set of APIs (e.g. different CRDs), its own RBAC, but as cheap and quick as a namespace.
  - title: "APIs as a Service."
    text: |-
      kcp extends Kubernetes' CRD extension model to an API export mechanism optimized for SaaS service providers offering APIs to thousands or many tens of thousands of user workspaces -- Securely and efficiently.
  - title: "Building Block, Not Walled Garden."
    text: |-
      kcp does not replace Kubernetes, but compliments it as a backend to host Kubernetes-like APIs as SaaS. It's a flexible framework for building platforms.
  - title: "Work at Global Scale."
    text: |-
      kcp schedules workspaces to kcp instances called shards, similarly to pods get scheduled to nodes. Our ambitions are to eventually reach 1 million workspaces and 10,000 shards.
  - title: "Beyond Compute."
    text: |-
      kcp intentionally only knows generic APIs, no pods or related resources. Our goal is to build a control plane for form factors beyond container orchestration.
  - title: "Based on Kubernetes. Not a Fork."
    text: |-
      kcp takes full advantage of Kubernetes API conventions, the glue that binds the Cloud Native Native technology ecosystem together and imbues Kubernetes' popular end-user experience. We live and breath Kubernetes and the community. No compromises.

community:
  title: "We ❤️ Collaboration"
  text: |-
    We develop kcp completely in the open. Everybody is welcome to help making the vision of kcp reality.
